# Shopify Plus Ecommerce Values
This repository is for a variable template for the Google Tag Manager Community Template Gallery.  The variable returns the selected value from the global Shopify object that are available when transactions are completed (typically on thank_you page).  These values are available when a transaction is complete and are only available to Shopify Plus customers.

# Return Value Options
This template includes selections for if you would like the value returned as a string or a number.  By default any currency based values in Shopify are strings, but there are times you may need the value returned as a number (e.g. Google Ads Conversion tags, etc.).
