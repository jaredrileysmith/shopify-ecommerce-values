# Shopify Plus Ecommerce Values
This repository is for a variable template for the Google Tag Manager Community Template Gallery.  The variable returns the selected value from the global Shopify object that are available when transactions are completed (typically on thank_you page).  These values are available when a transaction is complete and are only available to Shopify Plus customers.

# Option to Return Value as a Number
All currency values in the Shopify global object are recorded as strings.  This template includes an option (e.g. a checkbox) to return the value as a number for instances where the value needs to be a number (like Google Ads Conversion tags, etc.)
